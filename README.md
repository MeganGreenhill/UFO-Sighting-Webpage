# javascript-challenge

The purpose of this project was to develop a HTML web page with a table that outlines the date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment for a dataset of "UFO sightings". Using JavaScript, a code was developed to add new rows of data to the table for each UFO sighting, and also to listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
